# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Establishing the initial development loop for the Vibe Station project.
*   Setting up the core Nix flake (`flake.nix`).
*   Creating the initial Memory Bank files.

## Recent Changes

*   Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
*   Created `flake.nix` with basic inputs (`nixpkgs`, `flake-utils`) and a default `devShell` including `cowsay` and `lolcat`.
*   Successfully tested the `flake.nix` dev shell using Docker (`nixos/nix` image for `linux/amd64`) by running `echo hello | cowsay | lolcat`.
*   Created `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md`.
*   Added `pkgs.coder` to `flake.nix`.
*   Configured `flake.nix` to allow unfree packages (`config.allowUnfree = true;`) to resolve build error.
*   Successfully tested the updated `flake.nix` including `coder` using Docker (`coder --version` confirmed).
*   Added a `shellHook` to `flake.nix` to attempt installation of the `saoudrizwan.claude-dev` VS Code extension using `coder extensions install`.
*   Successfully tested that the `shellHook` executes without errors upon entering the `nix develop` environment via Docker.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2.  Address the next TODO: "Need step-by-step instructions for a user to run the Vibe Station coder workspace on their machine using docker". This involves creating documentation in the `/docs` directory as per `.clinerules/06-documentation.md`.
3.  Continue addressing other TODOs from `README.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Focusing on `linux/amd64` platform for initial setup as per `README.md` notes.
*   Using Docker with `nixos/nix` image for testing the Nix environment, following `.clinerules/03-testing.md`.
*   Ignoring Ruby gem warnings for now as they didn't impede the test.
*   Set `allowUnfree = true` globally within the flake for simplicity, as Coder requires it.

## Learnings & Insights

*   The basic Nix flake structure and Docker testing command are functional.
*   Memory Bank file creation is proceeding alongside development tasks.
*   Dependencies (like Terraform for Coder) can introduce license constraints that need explicit handling in Nix flakes.
*   The `shellHook` in `flake.nix` is a viable place to trigger Coder-specific setup commands like extension installation, although testing the actual installation requires a full Coder environment.
