# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Implemented a flake template approach for Vibe Station that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Focused on three usage options: as a flake template, included in home manager, or cloned and used directly.
*   Updated documentation to reflect the new approach.

## Recent Changes

*   Updated `flake.nix` to:
    *   Focus on being a template that can be used in multiple ways
    *   Add a templates.default section for use with nix flake init
    *   Maintain the core functionality of providing a code-server environment with Cline
*   Updated all references from `coder` binary to `code-server` binary throughout the project
*   Created new documentation in `docs/standalone-installation.md` with detailed instructions for the standalone installation.
*   Updated `docs/running-with-docker.md` to reference the new approach while maintaining Docker support.
*   Updated the main README.md to focus on the three usage options.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original Docker-based approach for users who prefer it.

## Next Steps

1.  Test the flake template approach on different platforms.
2.  Consider adding more examples for other languages/frameworks.
3.  Enhance the customization options in the flake.nix file.
4.  Consider adding more documentation on how to use Vibe Station with specific project types.
5.  Explore integration with other Nix-based tools and workflows.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Adopted a simpler approach focusing on the Nix flake template that can be easily cloned or included in home-manager.
*   Maintained the Docker-based approach for containerization as an alternative option.
*   Kept the focus on `linux/amd64` platform for initial setup.
*   Designed the flake to be easily customizable by modifying the buildInputs and shellHook.
*   Focused on users directly using the `code-server` binary rather than creating a custom CLI tool.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach for users who prefer it.

## Learnings & Insights

*   The flake template approach provides a cleaner separation between the development environment and project code.
*   Using Nix flakes allows for reproducible development environments across different machines.
*   The home-manager integration pattern is more aligned with how users expect development tools to work.
*   Maintaining backward compatibility ensures that existing users can continue to use the tool as they're accustomed to.
*   Simplifying the approach to focus on being a template makes it easier for users to understand and use.
