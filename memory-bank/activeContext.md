# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Implemented a flake template approach for Vibe Station that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Focused on three usage options: as a flake template, included in home manager, or cloned and used directly.
*   Updated documentation to reflect the new approach.
*   Successfully completed an end-to-end test using the Golang example with Docker.
*   Successfully tested the code-server functionality through the browser interface.
*   Discovered and documented the use of the `folder` query parameter to directly open specific folders in code-server.
*   Implemented overlayed profiles in Nix Home Manager to provide a layered approach to managing development environments.
*   Created a comprehensive testing script for validating the Home Manager configuration.
*   Developed a project template to demonstrate integration with the overlayed profiles.
*   Fixed an issue with the `homeConfigurations` structure in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` that was causing the test script to fail.
*   Optimized the Docker Compose setup to cache Docker-in-Docker images for better performance and resource efficiency.

## Recent Changes

*   Changed the Docker base image from nixos/nix to Debian with single-user Nix installation:
    *   Switched to debian:bookworm as the base image
    *   Installed Nix in single-user mode for the non-root 'coder' user
    *   Added necessary configurations to enable flakes and other Nix features
    *   Installed code-server and home-manager using nix-env
*   Updated `flake.nix` to:
    *   Focus on being a template that can be used in multiple ways
    *   Add a templates.default section for use with nix flake init
    *   Maintain the core functionality of providing a code-server environment with Cline
    *   Add home-manager as an input
    *   Export Home Manager modules for use in other flakes
    *   Add a project template for integration with overlayed profiles
*   Updated all references from `coder` binary to `code-server` binary throughout the project
*   Created new documentation in `docs/standalone-installation.md` with detailed instructions for the standalone installation.
*   Updated `docs/running-with-docker.md` to reference the new approach while maintaining Docker support.
*   Updated the main README.md to focus on the three usage options.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original Docker-based approach for users who prefer it.
*   Completed an end-to-end test of the Golang example using Docker:
    *   Successfully built and started the Docker container
    *   Ran the Go HTTP server inside the container using nix-shell
    *   Verified the server response using curl
    *   Confirmed the entire workflow functions correctly
*   Created a new subdirectory (`nix/home-manager`) with the necessary Nix files:
    *   `flake.nix`: Manages inputs and defines outputs
    *   `home.nix`: Main configuration file that imports profiles
    *   `profiles/base.nix`: Essential tools and configurations
    *   `profiles/personal.nix`: User-specific settings and preferences
*   Created a comprehensive README.md file in the `nix/home-manager` directory explaining the overlayed profiles and how to use them.
*   Added a testing script (`test-profiles.sh`) to validate the Home Manager configuration.
*   Created a project template to demonstrate integration with the overlayed profiles.
*   Fixed the structure of `homeConfigurations` in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` to be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration, rather than a nested structure that was causing the test script to fail.
*   Added `gnused` to the Dockerfile to fix an issue with the `test-profiles.sh` script that was failing because `sed` was missing from the Docker environment.
*   Successfully tested the Home Manager configuration build with the fixed `flake.nix` structure.
*   Optimized the Docker Compose setup to cache Docker-in-Docker images:
    *   Added a new volume `docker-images-data` to persist Docker images between container restarts
    *   Updated the Docker configuration in the base profile to use the mounted volume for storing images
    *   Updated documentation to explain the volume caching system

## Next Steps

1.  Complete the testing of the overlayed profiles within the Docker environment by:
    *   Running the full test script with appropriate modifications to avoid Docker-in-Docker issues
    *   Testing the direnv integration with the project template
2.  Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the `flake.nix` structure and the addition of `gnused` to the Dockerfile.
3.  Test the flake template approach on different platforms.
4.  Enhance the customization options in the flake.nix file.
5.  Consider adding more documentation on how to use Vibe Station with specific project types.
6.  Explore integration with other Nix-based tools and workflows.
7.  Potentially add more examples for other languages/frameworks.
8.  Fully test the extension installation within a real code-server environment.
9.  Consider mounting the host's Docker socket as a future optimization to allow the container to use the host's Docker daemon instead of running Docker-in-Docker.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Changed the Docker base image from nixos/nix to Debian with single-user Nix to allow running as a non-root user while still having full Nix functionality.
*   Adopted a simpler approach focusing on the Nix flake template that can be easily cloned or included in home-manager.
*   Maintained the Docker-based approach for containerization as an alternative option.
*   Kept the focus on `linux/amd64` platform for initial setup.
*   Designed the flake to be easily customizable by modifying the buildInputs and shellHook.
*   Focused on users directly using the `code-server` binary rather than creating a custom CLI tool.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach for users who prefer it.
*   Implemented a layered approach to managing development environments with overlayed profiles:
    *   Base layer for essential tools and configurations
    *   Personal layer for user-specific settings and preferences
    *   Project-specific layer for project environments via direnv
*   Created a testing script that validates the Home Manager configuration within a Docker environment.
*   Designed the project template to demonstrate how to integrate with the overlayed profiles.
*   Fixed the structure of `homeConfigurations` in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` to be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration, rather than a nested structure that was causing the test script to fail.
*   Added `gnused` to the Dockerfile to ensure the `test-profiles.sh` script can run successfully in the Docker environment.
*   Decided to optimize Docker-in-Docker performance by adding volume caching for Docker images while maintaining complete isolation of the container, rather than mounting the host's Docker socket which would have been faster but less isolated.

## Learnings & Insights

*   Using Debian with single-user Nix installation provides better flexibility for running as a non-root user while maintaining full Nix functionality.
*   The flake template approach provides a cleaner separation between the development environment and project code.
*   Using Nix flakes allows for reproducible development environments across different machines.
*   The home-manager integration pattern is more aligned with how users expect development tools to work.
*   Maintaining backward compatibility ensures that existing users can continue to use the tool as they're accustomed to.
*   Simplifying the approach to focus on being a template makes it easier for users to understand and use.
*   The code-server `folder` query parameter (e.g., `http://localhost:7080/?folder=/app/examples/golang`) provides a convenient way to directly open specific folders, improving the user experience.
*   Overlayed profiles provide a modular approach to managing development environments:
    *   Modularity: Easily add, remove, or modify specific aspects of the configuration
    *   Portability: Apply consistent configurations across different machines
    *   Maintainability: Simpler to update and extend over time
    *   Flexibility: Mix and match profiles based on needs (e.g., work vs. personal machines)
*   Direnv integration with Nix flakes creates a seamless development experience by automatically loading project-specific environments.
*   Testing within Docker provides a way to validate configurations without affecting the host system.
*   The structure of `homeConfigurations` in a Nix flake is important for proper integration with Home Manager. It should be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration, rather than a nested structure.
*   When running tests in a Docker environment, it's important to ensure that all required tools (like `sed`) are available in the environment.
*   When testing Home Manager configurations in a Docker environment, it's important to explicitly specify the username in the command, as the environment variable may not be passed correctly.
*   Docker volume caching provides significant performance benefits for Docker-in-Docker operations:
    *   Faster container startup times as images don't need to be re-downloaded
    *   Reduced disk space usage by avoiding duplicate image storage
    *   Improved testing efficiency when running tests that require Docker
    *   Maintaining container isolation while still optimizing performance
