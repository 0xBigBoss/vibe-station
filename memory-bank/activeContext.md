# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Completed all TODOs from the README.md.
*   Created a Golang example project to demonstrate using the Vibe Station workspace.
*   Updated documentation and Memory Bank files to reflect current progress.

## Recent Changes

*   Completed the Docker instructions in `docs/running-with-docker.md`, filling in the placeholder for accessing Coder.
*   Created a Golang example project in `examples/golang/` with:
    *   A simple HTTP server in `main.go`
    *   A Go module definition in `go.mod`
    *   A Nix flake in `flake.nix` that sets up a Go development environment
    *   A README.md with instructions on how to use the example
*   Updated the main README.md to reflect completed TODOs and provide links to documentation and examples.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect current progress.
*   Added a .clinerule for Docker to prevent direct reading of docker-compose.yml.

## Next Steps

1.  Consider adding more examples for other languages/frameworks.
2.  Refine Memory Bank files, especially `projectbrief.md`.
3.  Fully test the extension installation within a real Coder environment.
4.  Consider adding more detailed documentation on how to customize the Vibe Station workspace.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Focusing on `linux/amd64` platform for initial setup as per `README.md` notes.
*   Using Docker with `nixos/nix` image for testing the Nix environment, following `.clinerules/03-testing.md`.
*   Ignoring Ruby gem warnings for now as they didn't impede the test.
*   Set `allowUnfree = true` globally within the flake for simplicity, as Coder requires it.
*   Created a separate flake.nix for the Golang example to demonstrate how users can bring their own Nix flakes.

## Learnings & Insights

*   The basic Nix flake structure and Docker testing command are functional.
*   Memory Bank file creation is proceeding alongside development tasks.
*   Dependencies (like Terraform for Coder) can introduce license constraints that need explicit handling in Nix flakes.
*   The `shellHook` in `flake.nix` is a viable place to trigger Coder-specific setup commands like extension installation, although testing the actual installation requires a full Coder environment.
*   Organizing examples in a separate directory with their own flake.nix files makes it easier for users to understand how to use the Vibe Station workspace with their own projects.
