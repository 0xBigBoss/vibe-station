# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic Nix flake (`flake.nix`) structure is defined.
*   The flake includes `nixpkgs` and `flake-utils` inputs.
*   A default `devShell` is defined for each default system.
*   The `devShell` includes the `code-server` package.
*   The flake is configured to allow unfree packages (`config.allowUnfree = true;`).
*   The `devShell` (including `code-server`) can be successfully entered and used within a `nixos/nix` Docker container on `linux/amd64` (`code-server --version` confirmed).
*   A `shellHook` is added to `flake.nix` to attempt installation of the `saoudrizwan.claude-dev` extension via `code-server --install-extension`.
*   The `shellHook` executes successfully (without errors) when entering the dev shell via Docker.
*   Multiple development loops (Observe -> Orient -> Run -> Observe) for the flake setup were completed successfully.
*   Initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and updated.
*   Created documentation for running with Docker (`docs/running-with-docker.md`), including access instructions.
*   Created a Golang example project in `examples/golang/` with its own flake.nix, README.md, and a simple HTTP server.
*   Updated the main README.md to reflect completed TODOs and provide links to documentation and examples.
*   Added a .clinerule for Docker to prevent direct reading of docker-compose.yml.
*   Implemented a flake template approach for Vibe Station that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Added a templates.default section to flake.nix for use with nix flake init.
*   Created detailed documentation for the standalone installation process with three usage options.
*   Updated existing documentation to reference the new approach while maintaining Docker support.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach.

## What's Left to Build

*   Test the flake template approach on different platforms.
*   Enhance the customization options in the flake.nix file.
*   Consider adding more documentation on how to use Vibe Station with specific project types.
*   Explore integration with other Nix-based tools and workflows.
*   Potentially add more examples for other languages/frameworks.
*   Fully test the extension installation within a real code-server environment (cannot be done with current Docker test setup).

## Current Status

*   All TODOs from the README.md have been completed.
*   The project now has three approaches for using Vibe Station:
    *   Use as a Flake Template: Create a new project using the template
    *   Include in Home Manager: Add Vibe Station to your home-manager configuration
    *   Clone and Use Directly: Clone the repository and use it with or without Docker
*   A Golang example project is provided to demonstrate how to use the workspace.
*   Comprehensive documentation is available for both approaches.

## Known Issues

*   Ruby gem warnings observed during Docker test runs (currently ignored as non-blocking).
*   The `allowUnfree = true` setting is broad; could be refined later if needed.
*   The extension installation needs to be tested in a real code-server environment.
*   The flake template approach needs to be tested on different platforms.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus was on getting a runnable Nix environment with basic packages tested via Docker.
*   Added documentation and examples to make the project more user-friendly.
*   Organized the project structure to separate core functionality from examples.
*   Shifted to a flake template approach that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Adopted a simpler approach focusing on the Nix flake template that can be easily cloned or included in home-manager.
*   Focused on users directly using the `code-server` binary rather than creating a custom CLI tool.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach for users who prefer it.
