# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic Nix flake (`flake.nix`) structure is defined.
*   The flake includes `nixpkgs` and `flake-utils` inputs.
*   A default `devShell` is defined for each default system.
*   The `devShell` includes the `code-server` package.
*   The flake is configured to allow unfree packages (`config.allowUnfree = true;`).
*   The `devShell` (including `code-server`) can be successfully entered and used within a Debian-based Docker container with single-user Nix on `linux/amd64` (`code-server --version` confirmed).
*   A `shellHook` is added to `flake.nix` to attempt installation of the `saoudrizwan.claude-dev` extension via `code-server --install-extension`.
*   The `shellHook` executes successfully (without errors) when entering the dev shell via Docker.
*   Multiple development loops (Observe -> Orient -> Run -> Observe) for the flake setup were completed successfully.
*   Initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and updated.
*   Created documentation for running with Docker (`docs/running-with-docker.md`), including access instructions.
*   Created a Golang example project in `examples/golang/` with its own flake.nix, README.md, and a simple HTTP server.
*   Updated the main README.md to reflect completed TODOs and provide links to documentation and examples.
*   Added a .clinerule for Docker to prevent direct reading of docker-compose.yml.
*   Implemented a flake template approach for Vibe Station that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Added a templates.default section to flake.nix for use with nix flake init.
*   Created detailed documentation for the standalone installation process with three usage options.
*   Updated existing documentation to reference the new approach while maintaining Docker support.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach.
*   Successfully completed an end-to-end test of the Golang example using Docker:
    *   Built and started the Docker container with `docker compose up --build -d vibe-station`
    *   Ran the Go HTTP server inside the container using nix-shell with appropriate parameters
    *   Verified the server response using curl, confirming it returns "Hello from Vibe Station Golang Example!"
    *   Cleaned up resources by stopping the Docker container with `docker compose down`
*   Successfully tested the code-server functionality through the browser interface:
    *   Started the Docker container with code-server
    *   Accessed code-server through the browser
    *   Discovered and documented the use of the `folder` query parameter to directly open specific folders:
        ```
        http://localhost:7080/?folder=/app/examples/golang
        ```
    *   Updated documentation in `docs/running-with-docker.md` and `examples/golang/README.md` to include this information
*   Implemented overlayed profiles in Nix Home Manager:
    *   Created a new subdirectory (`nix/home-manager`) with the necessary Nix files (`flake.nix`, `home.nix`, `profiles/base.nix`, `profiles/personal.nix`).
    *   Created a comprehensive README.md file explaining the overlayed profiles and how to use them.
    *   Added a testing script (`test-profiles.sh`) to validate the Home Manager configuration.
    *   Created a project template to demonstrate integration with the overlayed profiles.
    *   Updated the main flake.nix to expose the Home Manager modules.
*   Fixed the structure of `homeConfigurations` in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` to be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration, rather than a nested structure that was causing the test script to fail.
*   Added `gnused` to the Dockerfile to fix an issue with the `test-profiles.sh` script that was failing because `sed` was missing from the Docker environment.
*   Successfully tested the Home Manager configuration build with the fixed `flake.nix` structure.
*   Optimized the Docker Compose setup to cache Docker-in-Docker images:
    *   Added a new volume `docker-images-data` to persist Docker images between container restarts
    *   Updated the Docker configuration in the base profile to use the mounted volume for storing images
    *   Updated documentation to explain the volume caching system
*   Resolved the conflict between imperative and declarative installation of `home-manager`:
    *   Removed `home-manager` from `nix-env` installation in Dockerfile
    *   Kept the declarative management in Home Manager configuration (`programs.home-manager.enable = true;`)
    *   Updated documentation to provide clear guidance on initial and subsequent Home Manager configuration activations
    *   Updated the test script to handle both initial and subsequent activations correctly
*   Fixed the test script (`test-profiles.sh`) to use `nix run github:nix-community/home-manager` for initial validation instead of directly calling `home-manager`, resolving the issue with the command not being available initially.
*   Completed Task 1 from the Docker and Home Manager Enhancements:
    *   Verified that passwordless sudo is working correctly for the coder user
    *   Confirmed the configuration in the Dockerfile: `echo "coder ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/coder`
    *   Successfully tested with `sudo -n id` command

## What's Left to Build

*   ✅ Complete the testing of the overlayed profiles within the Docker environment by:
    *   ✅ Running the full test script with appropriate modifications to avoid Docker-in-Docker issues
    *   Testing the direnv integration with the project template
*   ✅ Complete Docker and Home Manager Enhancements:
    *   ✅ Task 1: Passwordless sudo for coder user
    *   ✅ Task 2: Home Manager switch in Dockerfile - Completed and tested successfully
    *   Task 3: Parameterize App Directory
    *   Task 4: Code-Server Settings Configuration
    *   Task 5: Documentation Updates
*   Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the `flake.nix` structure and the addition of `gnused` to the Dockerfile.
*   Test the flake template approach on different platforms.
*   Enhance the customization options in the flake.nix file.
*   Consider adding more documentation on how to use Vibe Station with specific project types.
*   Explore integration with other Nix-based tools and workflows.
*   Potentially add more examples for other languages/frameworks.
*   Fully test the extension installation within a real code-server environment.

## Current Status

*   Completed Task 2 (Home Manager switch in Dockerfile) from the Docker and Home Manager Enhancements:
    *   Successfully implemented the home manager switch step in the Dockerfile
    *   Added a step to copy the home-manager directory to a temporary location
    *   Added a command to run `nix run github:nix-community/home-manager -- switch --flake` to apply the base configuration
    *   Added cleanup steps to remove temporary files and set the working directory back to /app
    *   Tested and confirmed working with:
        *   home-manager installed and working (version 25.05-pre)
        *   zsh installed in the expected location
        *   Essential packages from the base profile (git, curl, jq) installed
        *   Docker configuration file created correctly
        *   oh-my-zsh installed correctly

*   All TODOs from the README.md have been completed.
*   The Docker setup now uses a Debian-based image with Nix installed in single-user mode, allowing users to run as a non-root user while still having full Nix functionality.
*   The project now has three approaches for using Vibe Station:
    *   Use as a Flake Template: Create a new project using the template
    *   Include in Home Manager: Add Vibe Station to your home-manager configuration
    *   Clone and Use Directly: Clone the repository and use it with or without Docker
*   A Golang example project is provided to demonstrate how to use the workspace.
*   Comprehensive documentation is available for both approaches.
*   Successfully tested the code-server functionality through the browser interface.
*   Discovered and documented the use of the `folder` query parameter to directly open specific folders in code-server.
*   Implemented overlayed profiles in Nix Home Manager:
    *   Created a new subdirectory (`nix/home-manager`) with the necessary Nix files (`flake.nix`, `home.nix`, `profiles/base.nix`, `profiles/personal.nix`).
    *   Created a comprehensive README.md file explaining the overlayed profiles and how to use them.
    *   Added a testing script (`test-profiles.sh`) to validate the Home Manager configuration.
    *   Created a project template to demonstrate integration with the overlayed profiles.
    *   Updated the main flake.nix to expose the Home Manager modules.
*   Fixed issues with the Home Manager configuration:
    *   Fixed the structure of `homeConfigurations` in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` to be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration.
    *   Added `gnused` to the Dockerfile to ensure the `test-profiles.sh` script can run successfully.
    *   Successfully tested the Home Manager configuration build with the fixed `flake.nix` structure.
    *   Updated the test script to use `nix run github:nix-community/home-manager` for initial validation instead of directly calling `home-manager`, resolving the issue with the command not being available initially.
*   Optimized the Docker Compose setup for better performance:
    *   Added a new volume `docker-images-data` to persist Docker images between container restarts
    *   Updated the Docker configuration in the base profile to use the mounted volume for storing images
    *   Updated documentation to explain the volume caching system
*   Implemented a clean approach to manage `home-manager` purely declaratively:
    *   Removed `home-manager` from `nix-env` installation in Dockerfile
    *   Kept the declarative management in Home Manager configuration (`programs.home-manager.enable = true;`)
    *   Added instructions for initial activation using `nix run` and subsequent activations using `home-manager switch`
    *   This approach ensures a consistent and reliable Home Manager setup across different environments

## Known Issues

*   Ruby gem warnings observed during Docker test runs (currently ignored as non-blocking).
*   The `allowUnfree = true` setting is broad; could be refined later if needed.
*   The extension installation needs to be tested in a real code-server environment.
*   The flake template approach needs to be tested on different platforms.
*   The overlayed profiles implementation needs to be fully tested in a real environment.
*   The initial activation of Home Manager requires using `nix run` since the `home-manager` command isn't in the PATH until the first successful activation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus was on getting a runnable Nix environment with basic packages tested via Docker.
*   Added documentation and examples to make the project more user-friendly.
*   Organized the project structure to separate core functionality from examples.
*   Shifted to a flake template approach that can be used in multiple ways without requiring tight VCS integration.
*   Adopted a simpler approach focusing on the Nix flake template that can be easily cloned or included in home-manager.
*   Focused on users directly using the `code-server` binary rather than creating a custom CLI tool.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with the original approach for users who prefer it.
*   Implemented overlayed profiles in Nix Home Manager to provide a layered approach to managing development environments:
    *   Base layer for essential tools and configurations
    *   Personal layer for user-specific settings and preferences
    *   Project-specific layer for project environments via direnv
*   Fixed the structure of `homeConfigurations` in `nix/home-manager/flake.nix` to be a flat attrset with direct entries for each configuration, rather than a nested structure that was causing the test script to fail.
*   Added `gnused` to the Dockerfile to ensure the `test-profiles.sh` script can run successfully in the Docker environment.
*   Changed the Docker base image from nixos/nix to Debian with single-user Nix to allow running as a non-root user while still having full Nix functionality.
*   Optimized the Docker Compose setup for better performance by adding volume caching for Docker images, while maintaining complete isolation of the container (rather than mounting the host's Docker socket).
