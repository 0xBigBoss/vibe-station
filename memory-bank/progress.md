# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic Nix flake (`flake.nix`) structure is defined.
*   The flake includes `nixpkgs` and `flake-utils` inputs.
*   A default `devShell` is defined for `x86_64-linux`.
*   The `devShell` includes `cowsay`, `lolcat`, and `coder` packages.
*   The flake is configured to allow unfree packages (`config.allowUnfree = true;`).
*   The `devShell` (including `coder`) can be successfully entered and used within a `nixos/nix` Docker container on `linux/amd64` (`coder --version` confirmed).
*   A `shellHook` is added to `flake.nix` to attempt installation of the `saoudrizwan.claude-dev` extension via `coder extensions install`.
*   The `shellHook` executes successfully (without errors) when entering the dev shell via Docker.
*   Multiple development loops (Observe -> Orient -> Run -> Observe) for the flake setup were completed successfully.
*   Initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and updated.
*   Created documentation for running with Docker (`docs/running-with-docker.md`), including access instructions.
*   Created a Golang example project in `examples/golang/` with its own flake.nix, README.md, and a simple HTTP server.
*   Updated the main README.md to reflect completed TODOs and provide links to documentation and examples.
*   Added a .clinerule for Docker to prevent direct reading of docker-compose.yml.

## What's Left to Build

*   Refine Memory Bank files (especially `projectbrief.md`).
*   Fully test the extension installation within a real Coder environment (cannot be done with current Docker test setup).
*   Potentially add more examples for other languages/frameworks.
*   Consider adding more detailed documentation on how to customize the Vibe Station workspace.

## Current Status

*   All TODOs from the README.md have been completed.
*   The project now has a complete setup for running a Coder workspace with Nix via Docker.
*   A Golang example project is provided to demonstrate how to use the workspace.

## Known Issues

*   Ruby gem warnings observed during Docker test runs (currently ignored as non-blocking).
*   The `allowUnfree = true` setting is broad; could be refined later if needed.
*   The extension installation needs to be tested in a real Coder environment.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus was on getting a runnable Nix environment with basic packages tested via Docker.
*   Added documentation and examples to make the project more user-friendly.
*   Organized the project structure to separate core functionality from examples.
