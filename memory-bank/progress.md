# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic Nix flake (`flake.nix`) structure is defined.
*   The flake includes `nixpkgs` and `flake-utils` inputs.
*   A default `devShell` is defined for `x86_64-linux`.
*   The `devShell` includes `cowsay`, `lolcat`, and `coder` packages.
*   The flake is configured to allow unfree packages (`config.allowUnfree = true;`).
*   The `devShell` (including `coder`) can be successfully entered and used within a `nixos/nix` Docker container on `linux/amd64` (`coder --version` confirmed).
*   A `shellHook` is added to `flake.nix` to attempt installation of the `saoudrizwan.claude-dev` extension via `coder extensions install`.
*   The `shellHook` executes successfully (without errors) when entering the dev shell via Docker.
*   Multiple development loops (Observe -> Orient -> Run -> Observe) for the flake setup were completed successfully.
*   Initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and updated.
*   Created initial documentation for running with Docker (`docs/running-with-docker.md`).

## What's Left to Build (High Level from README TODOs)

*   Provide examples (starting with Golang) (Next focus).
*   Refine Memory Bank files (especially `projectbrief.md`).
*   Fully test the extension installation within a real Coder environment (cannot be done with current Docker test setup).
*   Complete placeholder sections in `docs/running-with-docker.md` (e.g., Coder access URL).

## Current Status

*   Actively working on building the core Nix flake (`flake.nix`).
*   Successfully added `coder` package and the extension installation `shellHook` to the flake and tested basic execution.
*   Created initial Docker usage documentation.
*   Preparing to address the next TODO: Creating a Golang example.

## Known Issues

*   Ruby gem warnings observed during Docker test runs (currently ignored as non-blocking).
*   `projectbrief.md` contains placeholder content.
*   The `allowUnfree = true` setting is broad; could be refined later if needed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus is on getting a runnable Nix environment with basic packages tested via Docker.
