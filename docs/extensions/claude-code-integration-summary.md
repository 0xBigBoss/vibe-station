# Claude Code Integration Summary

We've created an optional Claude Code integration for the vibe station that doesn't affect the repository state:

## Changes Made

1. Created a dedicated Home Manager profile (`claude-code.nix`) that:
   - Defines a toggleable option for enabling Claude Code
   - Sets up NodeJS 22 in the environment
   - Configures npm to install packages to the user's local directory
   - Provides an installation script that handles installing Claude Code
   - Updates PATH to include the local bin directory

2. Updated the Home Manager configuration to:
   - Support loading custom user configurations without modifying the repository
   - Make Claude Code optional rather than part of the default setup

3. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created detailed instructions in `docs/extensions/claude-code.md`
   - Added an example configuration in `examples/claude-code-config.nix`
   - Updated the README.md with information about the extension

4. Thoroughly tested the implementation:
   - Created test scripts to verify the approach works in Docker containers
   - Tested the module syntax and functionality
   - Ensured npm configuration works correctly

## Next Steps

For future development:

1. Fix the Claude Code executable name - it should be `claude` instead of `claude-code`:
   - Update `claude-code.nix` to rename the executable in the installation script
   - Change all documentation references from `claude-code` to `claude`
   - Modify the shell completion script to look for the right executable name
